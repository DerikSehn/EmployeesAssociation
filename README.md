# Employee Association Management System

This project was my first major undertaking back in 2023 üöÄ

## Project Overview

Earlier in 2023, I developed a comprehensive dashboard and a landing page for the employee association management system at Unimed Vale do Ca√≠. This pilot project took around 8 months (yeah, right? üòÖ) to develop from scratch, as it was my first time tackling something of this magnitude.

## System Features

- üîê **Permission Control Tools:** Ensuring secure access and management.
- üë§ **Native User Authentication and Authorization:** Implemented on the backend using Java.
- üåê **External API Integrations:** For real-time analysis and automatic generation of the member table, reflecting the status of Unimed employees based on data from S√™nior and Salux, two major healthtech companies in Brazil.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - MaterialUI
  - React Hooks (useEffect, useState, useContext, Custom Hooks)

- **Backend:**
  - Java Web Dynamic Project
  - REST
  - Servlet
  - Levenshtein metrics for queries generator
  - Postgres

Fun fact: All other functionalities were implemented natively, surprisingly making this a very light and performant system. ‚ö°

This project has been a significant milestone in my journey as a strong, resilient developer, and I'm so happy for the experience! üåü

Nowadays, I can see the difference this creation has made in my knowledge. I can confidently say:
